# Hello Hello!
This is a simple React-Redux + Express boilerplate that is both Windows + Mac compatible. It could help your app get the jump start it needs!

## Initial Setup
1. Clone the repo using git: `git clone https://github.com/jchen31995/Personal-React-Redux-Boilerplate.git`
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
3. Configure your `.env` file using the example `.env-example` file
4. To start the app, `npm run dev` for the development build or `npm start` for the production build

You should be up and running! Unless otherwise specified in your .env file, the app will start on port 3000 @ [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
